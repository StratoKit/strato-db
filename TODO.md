# TODO list

## General

- Give DB and ESDB the same API for registering models (.addModel)
- Optimize:
  - [ ] create benchmark
  - [ ] API to get prepared statements from JM .search
- Some mechanism to quit running processes when the schema changes. Maybe store a user-defined schema version in `PRAGMA application_id`? Isn't nice to have to check it every time data_version changes though :(

## node-sqlite3

### Someday

- [ ] sync interface for e.g. pragma data_version and BEGIN IMMEDIATE. Already did some work on it but it segfaults. Alternatively, use better-sqlite in a worker

## SQLite

### Important

- [ ] when opening, handle the error `{code: 'SQLITE_CANTOPEN'}` by retrying later

### Nice to have

- [ ] event emitter proxying the sqlite3 events
- [ ] `ensureTable(columns)`: accept column defs and create/add if needed, using pragma table_info

  ```text
  > pragma table_info("_migrations");
  cid|name|type|notnull|dflt_value|pk
  0|runKey|STRING|0||0
  1|ts|DATETIME|0||0
  2|up|BOOLEAN|0||0
  ```

- [ ] `ensureIndexes(indexes, dropUnused)` manage indexes, using PRAGMA index*list. Drop unused indexes with `\_sdb*` prefix
- [ ] create a worker thread version that uses better-sqlite. Benchmark.
- [ ] support better-sqlite if it's ok for the main thread to hang

### Someday

- [ ] with sqlite 3.22, use the btree info extension to provide index sizes at startup if debug enabled
- When async iterators are here, make one for db.each. Although it seems that node-sqlite3 actually slurps the entire table into an array.

## DB

### Nice to have

- [ ] if migration is `{undo:fn}` run the `undo` only if the migration ran before. We never needed `down` migrations so far.
  - to run something only on existing databases, first deploy a `()=>{}` migration and then change it to an `undo`

## JsonModel

### Important

- FTS5 support for text searching
  - Real columns marked `textSearch: true|string|object` generate a FTS5 index
  - one index per textSearch value ("tag")
  - It uses the table as a backing table
  - FTS options can be passed as an object with `tag` for the textSearch value
  - Searching passes the search argument to the tagged FTS5 index limited to the column
  - Changes are applied by JM, not triggers. Generating
    The tags are there to allow multilingual searching. Another column should be added to allow searching all columns in the tagged index.
    Need to come up with nicer configuration keys. Also something for custom tokenizing
- [ ] columns using the same path should get the same JSON path. There are some edge cases.
- [ ] falsyBool paging doesn't work because it tries to >= and that fails for null. It should add a "sortable: false" flag

### Nice to have

- [ ] validate(value): must return truthy given the current value (from path or value()) or storing throws
- [ ] column.version: defaults to 1. When version increases, all rows are rewritten
  - do not change extra columns, that is what migrations are for
- [ ] recreate index if expression changes
- [ ] indexes: `[{expression, where}]` extra indexes
  - [ ] auto-delete other indexes, API change
- [x] if column value is function, call with `({columnName})` => helpers
  - [ ] objectColumn() helper -> type=JSON, NULL === {}, stringify checks if object (char 0 is `{`)
  - [ ] boolColumn() -> `type="INTEGER"; parse = Boolean; stringify=Boolean`
  - [ ] falsyColumn() -> implement falsyBool
    - note that `col.where = (${col.sql} IS NULL)=?` doesn't need a where function but won't use a sparse index.
      So maybe, for sparse index falsybool, only do 'is not null' and throw if false
  - [ ] uuidColumn() -> use buffer stringify/parse to implement efficient UUID by default. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20342058/which-uuid-version-to-use
- [ ] foreign key support
- [ ] prepared statements for .search
  - `q = m.prepareSearch(args, options); q.search(args, options) // not allowed to change arg items, where or sort`
  - However, `whereVal` values should be allowed to change
  - But `where` should stay the same and should not be recalculated, so best if it is not a function. Most of the time this can be done.
  - Probably `.makeSelect()` would need to return an intermediate query object
  - Note: When using prepared statements, replace `IN (?,?,?)` clauses with `IN (SELECT value FROM json_each(?))` and pass the array as a JSON string. That way the prepared statement can handle any array length
- Benchmark test that warns if runtime increases on current system
  - getting/setting can be optimized by creating Functions instead of lodash get/set, but first create benchmark
  - it's probably better to always create same object from columns and then assign json if not null
- Test for `uniqueSlugId`
- Booleans should be stored as 0/1 if real, except when sparse indexing, then NULL/1. If not real, the index and where clause should be `IFNULL(json..., false)`

## Queue

### Important

- [ ] allow marking an event as being processed, by setting worker id `where workerId is null` or something similar
- [ ] workers should register in a table and write timestamps for a watchdog
- [ ] while an event is being worked, next event can't be worked on.

### Nice to have

- [ ] split history into multiple files, per 1GB, automatically attach for queries. (make sure it's multi-process safe - lock the db, make sure new writes are not possible in old files)
- [ ] test multi-process changes

## ESModel

### Nice to have

- [ ] implement `.changeID`. It requires applyEvent to support `mv`
- [ ] .get for the RO ESModel uses .getCached, with a caching-map limiting the amount, cleared when the version changes
- [ ] .changeId (`mv:[[oldId, newId],…]` apply action?)

## ESDB

### Nice to have

- [ ] don't store empty result sub-events
- [ ] `reducerByType` object keyed by type that gets the same arguments as preprocessor
  - same for preprocessor/deriver
- [ ] explore read-only DBs that get the event queue changes only, dispatches go to master db
