# Server Side Redux

## Concept

Run a Redux-like cycle on the server side to transform incoming events into database writes.

Basic ideas from [Turning The Database Inside Out](https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/) talk.

## Parts

- **Version**: All changes have a `version`, an arbitrary monotonously increasing sortable value.
- **Event**: An object with `version` (assigned by the queue), `type` and arbitrary `data` to describe a desired change to server state.
  - Examples: "this `user` logged in", "this `user` requested changing this `document`", "this `weatherData` arrived", …
- **Event queue**: A FIFO store, holding events until they are processed.
  - This should be a very reliable store.
  - When an `event` is put on the queue, it gets a unique incremented `version`.
- **State**: The state consists of sets of objects with at-least-per-set-unique-ids.
  - Database tables can store a row per set entry, so that's what we'll do. Each set is a table. We also store the current version in a separate one-row table (so that concurrent transactions conflict). The database is presumed to always be consistent (all tables and version in sync).
- **Middleware => Preprocessors**: Redux middleware is mostly implemented as preprocessor functions that run within the event handling transaction, and can alter the event based on data from all tables.
- **Reducers**: Reducers are pure functions that get current state and the event, and return a description of what should happen to the state to get to the next version.
  - Current state (the DB model) is accessed by calling (asynchronous) DB functions
  - Each reducer is responsible for a single set (table) and can't read other sets
  - Given the same state and event, the reducer always returns the same result
  - The result is an object `{error: {message: "..."}, set: [{id, ...}], rm: [id, ...], audit, ...}`
    - `error`: Present if the event can not be processed for some reason, contains information to debug the problem. This halts all event processing until the problem is fixed. To represent e.g. denial of requests, use a different key (ESModel uses `esFail`) and inspect the event result to see if it the request was granted.
    - Several keys are used by the JsonModel `applyEvent`:
      - `set`: objects to replace in the table
      - `ins`: objects to insert in the table (errors if exist)
      - `upd`: objects to shallow-update
      - `sav`: objects to shallow-update or insert if missing
      - `rm`: ids of objects to remove from the table
      - by subclassing, the behavior can be tweaked
    - any other keys: opaque data describing the change, can be informational or used by a custom `applyEvent`
  - **Derivers**: Functions that calculate "secondary state" from the changes. They can serve to make the event result smaller
- **History**: An ordered list of reduced events (so `{version, type, data, result}`). This is not required, and the event can be abridged. It could serve as an audit log. If all the original event data is retained, it can be used to reprocess the database from scratch.
- **Sub-events**: To make the event processing code simpler, ESDB allows dispatching further events from anywhere in the redux cycle. These events are processed depth-first. For example, a USER_LOGIN event can result in a USER_REGISTERED event if they logged in via OAuth for the first time.

## Flow

- Inbox cycle:

  - An event comes in. Think of events as newspaper headlines, they describe something that happened. They are not commands, they are facts and requests.
    - Any event that needs external information to process should be split up into multiple asynchronous events that have all the necessary data.
  - **Dispatch**: The event is stored on the queue and auto-assigned a version `v`

- Redux cycle:
  - **Wait for event**: get the v+1 event from the queue
  - **Preprocess**: `preprocess`ors can change the event object before it's passed to the reducers. They should return the new event object if they change it. Version cannot change, but e.g. id could be assigned.
  - **Reduce**:
    - The event is passed to all `reducer`s
    - Reducers produce a change description
    - Event object becomes history object with `result` attribute
  - **Apply**
    - Starts transaction
    - All results are written, including history object
    - The way they are written is arbitrary, implemented by an `applyEvent` method
  - **Derive**
    - `deriver`s are called with the history object
    - They change their models as they see fit
    - Failing derivers abort the transaction
    - Ends transaction. The DB is now at the event version.
- These steps run in a single transaction. If any step fails, the transaction is rolled back and retried later. All later events are held until the error is resolved, possibly through manual resolution. As such, avoid errors at all times. Events should be self-contained.

  - Listeners: They can get called with the history object after the Redux cycle completes

The Inbox flow can happen at any time; the Reduce/Write cycle happens sequentially.

If an incoming request is for some side-effect change, this should be stored as a sequence of events, recording the intent, the intermediate states and the end result. The database is then used by listeners to know the current state of side-effects.

## Advantages

All the advantages of Redux, but applied to the server:

- time travel (requires snapshots or reversible events (storing the full calculated change with the event))
- clean code, easy to unit test
- reprocessing: just start from 0
- reducers can run in parallel, interleaving I/O requests
- easy to generate audit log

## Limitations

### Risks

- Data loss can occur in all the normal ways, but the event log in essence duplicates the data
- The hard-line approach of failing events halting event processing can result in servers needing immediate care, but it is really the only sane way to handle data, and the event handling code should be robust

### Model

It is sometimes harder to model all changes as events, for example spawning side effects and keeping track of their state.

### Resource use

- Requires a data store with transactions, so that the new state and history is stored in one go.
- Not well suited for high-volume writes due to per-event "synchronous" updating. Caching can help. Reducers can run in parallel though.
- Not well suited for change sets exceeding available working memory. (e.g. delete all records). Those have to be special-cased within the `applyEvent` code.
- Not well suited for huge events (e.g. >2MB of data in the event). Move data out of the event into files etc.
- Single master for event queue. Sharding might help if that's a problem.

## Implementation

Up until v3 this was implemented by redux with changes for asynchronous behavior, but in v3 the concepts were implemented directly to allow for sub-events.

### GraphQL mutations

Mutations assume that they can return either with an Error or the result value of the mutation. This means keeping track of the event execution as it passes through all the layers. To that end, `dispatch` tracks event completion even if it happened in another process.

## DevOps Scenarios

### Start from existing database

- Add history and version table, mark all tables as a first version
- Add new reducers, see below

### Add new table/reducer

- Add reducer to reducers
- Either:
  - Calculate/provide table at current db version in a migration
  - Start empty, run all stored events

### Change reducer

- Change reducer in reducers
- Either:
  - Convert table in a migration
  - Start empty, run all stored events

### Running out of disk

- Prune history
  - Remove old entries, perhaps keeping the last X, as well as important ones
  - Remove metadata of old entries, perhaps only keeping the audit information
- Upgrade the server

### Running out of CPU

- Shard DB: create more writers
  - Copy the DB to multiple masters
  - Replace the reducers with sharding versions
  - Update tables in a migration, pruning data not belonging to the shard
- Duplicate servers: create more readers
  - Copy the DB etc to multiple readers
  - Synchronize events so there is absolute ordering and no previous version insertions after a version was stored in the DB
- Upgrade the server
